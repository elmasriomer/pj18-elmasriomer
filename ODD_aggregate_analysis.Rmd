## Install Package
In week 2 ODD data have been studied. Now we combine all data in order to have detailed analyses with collected data.
Here, We need to install required packages.

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse", repos = "https://cran.r-project.org")
install.packages("formattable", repos = "https://cran.r-project.org")
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(formattable)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
```

## Download Raw Data
Here we get data from github repository with reading and assigning it to a dataframe.

```{r}
#download from github 
github_URL <- ("https://github.com/MEF-BDA503/pj18-elmasriomer/blob/master/car_data_aggregate.rds?raw=true")
all_data<- readRDS(url(github_URL))
#check rows,columns, also head and tail
glimpse(all_data)
head(all_data)
tail(all_data)
```

## Analyzing Overall Dataset and Cleaning Data
```{r}
control_data <- all_data%>%
  group_by (brand_name)%>%
  summarize(count=n())
#View(control_data) #contol_data is used to see overall

#When we had a quick view to the aggreated data, there are some phrases in brandnames including "ODD.." and "TOPLAM". 

cleaned_data <- all_data %>% filter(! (startsWith(brand_name, "ODD") | startsWith(brand_name, "TOPLAM")))%>%
  group_by (brand_name)%>%
  summarize(count=n())
#View(cleaned_data) #clean_data is used to see the result of filtering

#Also there are two brand name rows referred to unique brandname  but spellled different that is needed to be consolidated (ASTON MARTIN, ASTON MARTİN).
all_data$brand_name <- str_replace(all_data$brand_name,"ASTON MARTİN","ASTON MARTIN")

control_data_2 <- all_data%>%filter(! (startsWith(brand_name, "ODD") | startsWith(brand_name, "TOPLAM")))%>%
  group_by (brand_name)%>%
  summarize(count=n())
#View(control_data_2) #control_data_2 is used to see the result of both of str_replace and filtering

final_data <- all_data %>% filter(! (startsWith(brand_name, "ODD") | startsWith(brand_name, "TOPLAM"))) #filtering is applied to actual data, re_named as final_data. We will use this. 
#View(final_data)

```

##  Data Analyze
```{r}
#I would like to see the brand with highest car sales overall where both of automobile and commercial vehicle sales over 0. Then I would like to see the trend of commercial cars sales as domestic and import; also commercial car sales as domestic and import.

top_three <- final_data %>% 
  filter(auto_total > 0 & comm_total > 0) %>%
  select(brand_name, auto_dom, auto_imp, comm_dom, comm_imp, month, year, total_total) %>%
  group_by (brand_name)%>%
  summarize(total_by_brand = sum(total_total))%>%
  arrange(desc(total_by_brand))%>%
  slice(1:3)
#View(top_three)
#The highest car sales comes from Renault. Let's see the trends commercial cars sales as domestic and import; also commercial car sales as domestic and import.

```

```{r}
#View(final_data)
sales_monthly <- final_data %>% 
              group_by(year, month)   %>%

              arrange(year, month)   %>% slice(1:12)

sales_monthly$Date <- zoo::as.yearmon(paste(sales_monthly$year,sales_monthly$month), "%Y %m")
sales_monthly$DateFormated <- format(sales_monthly$Date,"%Y-%m")
#View(sales_monthly)
```

```{r}
sales_monthly_Renault <- final_data %>% 
              filter(brand_name=="RENAULT") %>% 
              group_by(year, month)   %>% 
              summarise(total_sales=sum(total_total), total_import=sum(total_imp), total_domestic=sum(total_dom),total_automobil=sum(auto_total), total_commercial=sum(comm_total), brand_name) %>%
              arrange(year, month)   %>% slice(1:12)

sales_monthly_Renault$Date <- zoo::as.yearmon(paste(sales_monthly$year,sales_monthly$month), "%Y %m")
sales_monthly_Renault$DateFormated <- format(sales_monthly$Date,"%Y-%m")
View(sales_monthly_Renault)
```


```{r}
sales_monthly_Renault %>% 
                  ggplot(aes(x = DateFormated, y = total_sales, group=1)) + 
                  #ggtitle("Total Sales trend of Renault") + 
                  geom_line() + 
                  geom_point() +
                  theme(legend.position = "none", axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 0.0, size = 10)) +
                  scale_linetype_discrete()+
                  ggtitle("Total Sales Trend of Renault")
